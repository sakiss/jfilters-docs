### Generating Filters
The component will, auto-generate the filters and set them as unpublished by default.

If your site is multilingual you may see filters with the same name, more than once.
It is because it generates a filter for each installed language.

### Publish Filters
Publish the filters you need to use, and we are almost ready to go.

:::info
We suggest keeping a "Category" filter to either a *published* or a *listening* state.
Why? Only filters in *published* or *listening* state are listening to the incoming HTTP requests. To have filters relevant to the content of your category pages, a category filter should listen to incoming requests. Also, make sure that you did not set a [Parent Option](/component/filter-config/tree#parent-option) that excludes categories for your main  "Category" filter.
